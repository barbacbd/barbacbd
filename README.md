### Hello! I'm Brent (barbacbd) ðŸ‘‹

I have been developing since I was in highschool (an amount of time I am becoming more scared to admit). I enjoy spending 
most of my time outside with family and friends. I mention this because it is also where a lot of my personal programming 
originates. I have used python, C, and C++ substantially during my entire professional career. I also have experience with
languages such as R, Go (Golang if you prefer), Lua, Javascript, and Java.
