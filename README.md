### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Brent

I am a senior software engineer at [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com). I support the Openshift-Installer and Openshift-Ansible projects with an emphasis on AWS and GCP platform development.

<br>

I previously worked as a software architect and engineer for a startup called Spatial Integrated Systems. I spent my time designing, creating, and leading autonomous surface vessels. I have experience with small and large vessels ranging from 5 feet to 200+ feet. 

<br>

I also have experiene working for the government as a software engineer with a focus on communication systems operating during wartime efforts with a MTTB less than 0.05%.
