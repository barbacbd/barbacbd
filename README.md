### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Brent (barbacbd) 

I have been developing since I was in highschool (an amount of time I am becoming more scared to admit). I enjoy spending 
most of my time outside with family and friends. The majority of my personal programming experiences are driven by my love of the outdoors. 

I have spent all of my professional career developing on linux systems. I had a strong desire to work for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/our-code-is-open?sc_cid=7013a000002q2WoAAI&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4ufL5cfB-AIVi47ICh3XbQDDEAAYASAAEgKExvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). In 2022, I jumped at the opportunity to experience life at Red Hat. 

I have experience with python, Go, C, and C++ substantially during my professional career. I also have experience with
languages such as R, Lua, Javascript, Bash, and Java.

### âš¡ What is with the VW Bus?

I have a fascination with cars (and so does my son). I love to surf too, and the VW Bus has always been my dream car! It is my goal to save up, buy, and restore a VW Bus. I would like to think that the VW Bus is a nice summary of me, so it is the image/symbol I choose to use.
